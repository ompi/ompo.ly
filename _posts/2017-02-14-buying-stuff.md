Try buying exactly the same Cisco SF100D-05 model you've just opened. 
Find tiny nixie tubes matching your tiny switch. Realize these tubes come
in packs of six. Damn these six-digit clocks.

This is a 100 Mbps switch but I'm okay with a two-digit speed display so
two tubes it is. ИН-8 tubes are ⌀19✕45mm. That feels about right on a
110✕30✕75mm box.

I'm cheating with the date here. Actually, these things have been lying
around for a year now. And, as expected, the SF100D-05 I bought has a
slightly different PCB revision. The chip is the same so that's not really
a problem.
