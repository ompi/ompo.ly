I've always wanted to build something with nixie tubes. But not a clock. 
It has been done a million times over. There's no way I'm building
yet another nixie clock. Besides, I have project clocky for that now.

The other thing I wanted to build is a network speed indicator gadget.
A standalone box. Not a PC peripheral that gets the speed from your OS,
nor a bridging Linux box. A hacked Ethernet switch with a huge analog
meter or something like that.

So the plan goes like this: Find a probably hackable switch. Hack it.
Stick a micro and nixie tubes in it. Profit. Turn a dumb switch into
a fancy managed switch? Maybe.
